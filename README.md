# Deep-AUC-maximisation

There are many techniques available for learning a deep neural network. Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a new paradigm for learning a deep neural network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. This technique has achieved great success in solving real-world problems. Although DAM has achieved great success on large-scale datasets, it might easily overfit on small training data. In this project we work on the medical image dataset MedMNIST to develop strategies to improve the generalization ability of DAM for
medical image classification tasks.
